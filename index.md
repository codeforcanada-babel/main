Welcome to Project Babel's wiki!

We are part of the 5th cohort of fellows at Code For Canada, a non-profit that works closely with government to deliver better digital services to the public. For our fellowship, we will work with the ESDC (Employment and Social Development Canada) on a solution for measuring the impact of policy changes.

The fellowship is a 10-month program where a team of fellows (us) works with a government department on a project that will improve delivery of digital services. The fellows work as a self-organizing team responsible for tasks, including:
- Refining project requirements
- Conducting user research
- Designing and prototyping a solution
- Collecting feedback and iterating on the solution
- Delivering a product at the end of the fellowship
- Ensuring a smooth transition of the project to the government partner at the end of the fellowship

This wiki is intended to be an open and evolving source of truth on all aspects of our project.
